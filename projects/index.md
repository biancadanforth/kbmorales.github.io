### Net Neutrality: Fake Comments
<span class="label">Report (May 2021)</span>

An investigation into the 22 million comments filed online to the [Federal Communications Commission's proposed 2017 rule change](https://www.fcc.gov/restoring-internet-freedom-comments-wc-docket-no-17-108) regarding "net neutrality," revealing a massive astroturfing campaign lead by the largest telecom companies in the United States. We found that 18 million of these comments had indications that they were fake.
