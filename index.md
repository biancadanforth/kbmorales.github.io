## Hi, I'm Ken
        
I am passionate about the uses of big and small data for social justice. I work with Python and R.

I am currently a data scientist for the [New York State Office of the Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a researcher at the [Johns Hopkins School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-behavior-and-society/research-and-practice){:target="_blank"} focusing on the social epidemiology of drug use.

In my spare time, I like to ride my bicycle, read, and play board and video games.

I currently live in Brooklyn, New York. Feel free to reach out via any of the contact links below.
