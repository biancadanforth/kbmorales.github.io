![Hi I am kenny](files/bike_pic.jpg)

I work as a data scientist, mostly in R. I am also a researcher at a school of public health, where my research primarily focuses on survey epidemiology among vulnerable populations like people who use drugs and street-based sex workers.

In my spare time, I like to garden, read, and play board games.
